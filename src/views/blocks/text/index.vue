        <h1 class="mt-1 text-3xl font-bold" style="width: fit-content">
          Text Block
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
          The general-purpose rich-text block. Content is written directly on the canvas with a
          floating formatting toolbar; the sidebar carries only the layout and styling controls
          that toolbar doesn't cover.
        </p>
      </header>

      <Section id="overview" title="Overview">
        <p>
          Text is the block you reach for most. It holds inline-styled HTML — bold, italic,
          links, lists, colors — authored in place rather than in a sidebar field.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="editing" title="Editing the text">
        <p>
          <strong>Double-click the block on the canvas</strong> to start editing. A formatting
          toolbar appears while the block is selected.
        </p>
        <BlockCallout title="There is no sidebar content field — by design">
          Earlier versions had a second rich-text editor in the sidebar alongside the canvas
          one. Two editing surfaces bound to the same field raced against each other and broke
          undo/redo, so the sidebar editor was removed. The canvas is the only place text is
          edited.
        </BlockCallout>
      </Section>

      <Section id="ai" title="Generate with AI">
        <p>
          The sidebar has an AI prompt field that generates rich text for this block. Describe
          what you want and press <strong>Generate</strong>; the result replaces the block's
          current content.
        </p>
        <PropertyCard type="prompt">
          <strong>AI prompt</strong> — a three-row textarea. Generation is aware of the page
          it sits on: the request carries the page name, title, slug, meta title, meta
          description, meta keywords, and any stored page research, so the copy matches the
          page's subject and tone.
        </PropertyCard>
        <PropertyCard type="speech-to-text">
          <strong>Voice input</strong> — a microphone button inside the prompt field where the
          browser supports speech recognition. Dictation only runs while the prompt field has
          focus, so it stops automatically when you click away. Each finished phrase is
          appended to what's already there, so you can dictate in several passes.
        </PropertyCard>
        <PropertyCard type="image upload">
          <strong>Reference images</strong> — attach images to send along with the prompt as
          additional context. Attached file names are listed under the button.
        </PropertyCard>
        <BlockCallout variant="warning" title="Generation replaces existing content">
          The generated text overwrites whatever is in the block. Copy anything you want to
          keep before generating.
        </BlockCallout>
      </Section>

      <Section id="style" title="Background & spacing">
        <PropertyCard type="color | null" default-value="null">
          <strong>Background</strong> — solid color or gradient behind the text, with a hex
          readout next to the swatch.
        </PropertyCard>
        <PropertyCard type="per-side spacing" default-value="0 on all sides">
          <strong>Padding</strong> and <strong>Margin</strong>
        </PropertyCard>
        <PropertyCard type="'normal' | 'bold' | numeric">
          <strong>Font weight</strong> — the block-level default weight. Inline bold applied
          with the canvas toolbar still wins over it.
        </PropertyCard>
        <PropertyCard type="'left' | 'center' | 'right'">
          <strong>Text align</strong>
        </PropertyCard>
      </Section>

      <Section id="responsive" title="Per-device behaviour">
        <p>
          Padding, margin, font weight, and text alignment can each differ per device — switch
          to the Tablet or Mobile tab and set a different value. Each device falls back to
          <strong>Desktop</strong> when unset; Tablet and Mobile are independent, so Mobile does
          not inherit a value you set on Tablet.
        </p>
        <BlockCallout title="Not per-device">
          The text content itself and the AI generation controls are shared across devices, so
          they're hidden on the Tablet/Mobile tabs. Write the copy once on Desktop.
        </BlockCallout>
